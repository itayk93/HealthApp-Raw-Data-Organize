# HealthApp

Hey! This code purpose is to organise the xml file with all the data collected from Health App on Iphone.
It organises the data into several files which are ready to upload to any BI system (in my cace - Tableau)

Instructions:

Download the raw data (in XML format) from the Health App on your iPhone.
Locate the downloaded file in the "Input" folder.
In the "main_folder_location.xlsx" file, specify the location of your folder.
In the "final_files_to_make.xlsx" file, specify the files you want to export at the end. There are many different kinds of measurements in the original data, and you may not need all of them.
In the "device_holder.xlsx" file, specify your name as the device's holder. This will be included in the final data.
In the "dates_to_cancel.xlsx" file, specify any dates you want to delete from the final data before uploading it to a BI system.
In the "data_to_cancel.xlsx" file, specify any specific data you want to delete from the final data before uploading it to a BI system (you can copy the data from the output after running the script).
Finally, you can run the "Health App Script.py" script.

Thank you for using this software.
